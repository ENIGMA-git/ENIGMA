# Welcome to the GitHub for [ENIGMA](http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/)

The ENIGMA Consortium is an international effort by leaders worldwide. The 
Network brings together researchers in imaging genomics, neurology and 
psychiatry, to understand brain structure and function, based on MRI, DTI, fMRI,
genetic data and many patient populations.

The best return on our research investments will come from combining our data to
achieve the large samples necessary to detect the modest gene effect sizes that 
we now know are the rule rather the exception for complex traits.

The ENIGMA Network has several goals:

*   to create a network of like-minded individuals, interested in pushing 
    forward the field of imaging genetics
*   to ensure promising findings are replicated via member collaborations, in 
    order to satisfy the mandates of most journals
*   to share ideas, algorithms, data, and information on promising findings or 
    methods
*   to facilitate training, including workshops and conferences on key methods 
    and emerging directions in imaging genetics.
